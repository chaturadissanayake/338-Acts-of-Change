    <h2>338 Acts of Change</h2>

    <p>
      This project is an exploration of how visual communication can provide clarity and insight into complex development data. The project represents <strong>338 initiatives</strong> that shaped Sri Lanka in 2024, illustrated through a spiral chart. Each dot on the chart symbolizes an individual project aimed at strengthening communities, informing policy, and enhancing resilience.
    </p>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="Assets/Main 338.jpg" alt="Chart" class="image-box" id="image1" onclick="openImageModal(this.src)">
    </div>

    <p>
      The design seeks to bridge the gap between <em>technical data</em> and public understanding. In today’s data-driven world, transparency and accessibility are essential. By transforming raw numbers into a cohesive visual, this project fosters an engaging way to understand Sri Lanka’s development progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data for this project was sourced from the <strong>UN INFO Platform – United Nations in Sri Lanka (2024)</strong>, categorizing the 192 initiatives into thematic areas such as capacity development, service delivery, policy advice, and more. These themes provide a snapshot of the diverse efforts underway across Sri Lanka to build a more sustainable future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than simply presenting a count of initiatives, the goal is to bring these <em>development efforts to life</em>. Through a straightforward visual language, this project prioritizes clarity and structure while maintaining a sense of flow and interconnection across the various initiatives.
    </p>

    <div class="image-row">
      <img src="Assets/338.gif" alt="Interactive Animation" class="image-box" id="image2" onclick="openImageModal(this.src)">
    </div>

    <p>
      The interactive animation adds a dynamic layer to the project, visually illustrating the relationship and progression of initiatives over time. It serves to engage the viewer and animate the chart, making it easier to digest the interconnectivity of Sri Lanka’s development efforts.
