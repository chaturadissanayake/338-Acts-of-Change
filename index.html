    <h2>338 Acts of Change</h2>

    <p>
      This project explores the potential of visual communication to represent complex development data in an accessible and impactful format. Centered around a spiral chart, the work captures <strong>338 initiatives</strong> that shaped Sri Lanka in 2024—each dot representing a project aimed at strengthening communities, informing policy, or building resilience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The design was inspired by a need to bridge the gap between <em>technical reporting and public understanding</em>. By translating quantitative data into a cohesive visual form, the project supports transparency and encourages engagement with development progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drawing from the <strong>UN INFO Platform – United Nations in Sri Lanka (2024)</strong>, the dataset categorizes initiatives into eight distinct thematic areas: capacity development, service delivery, data and analysis, partnerships and knowledge, policy advice, coordination, support functions, and other.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work is not just about counting projects—it’s about making <em>development efforts visible and tangible</em>. The visual language prioritizes clarity, hierarchy, and simplicity while maintaining a sense of motion and cohesion.
