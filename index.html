    <h2>338 Acts of Change</h2>

    <p>
      This project is a powerful exploration into how visual communication can bring clarity to complex development data. It presents <strong>338 initiatives</strong> that shaped Sri Lanka in 2024, using a spiral chart to represent a variety of projects aimed at strengthening communities, informing policy, and building resilience. Each dot in the chart represents an individual initiative that has contributed to the nation's sustainable development.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project's design was driven by the necessity to bridge the gap between <em>technical reporting</em> and public understanding. In this increasingly data-driven world, transparency and clarity are vital. By transforming complex quantitative data into a cohesive visual representation, this work invites engagement and fosters an understanding of the progress being made in Sri Lanka’s development landscape.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data presented comes from the <strong>UN INFO Platform – United Nations in Sri Lanka (2024)</strong>, which categorizes 192 initiatives into key thematic areas: capacity development, service delivery, data analysis, partnerships, policy advice, and more. This breakdown offers a snapshot of the diverse efforts taking place across the country.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, this visual project is more than just about counting the number of initiatives. It's about making <em>development efforts visible and tangible</em> for all stakeholders. The goal was to create a simple yet powerful visual language that prioritizes clarity and hierarchy, while maintaining a sense of fluidity and cohesion in its design.
