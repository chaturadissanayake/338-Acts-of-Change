    <h2>338 Acts of Change</h2>

    <p>
      Sri Lanka's development story is one of resilience, growth, and transformation. <strong>338 Acts of Change</strong> isn’t just a collection of numbers; it's a reflection of a nation’s journey, showcasing the impactful work being done in various communities to shape a better future. The purpose of this project isn’t just to display a series of initiatives but to tell the story behind each of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the heart of this project is a visual chart that breaks down 338 initiatives—each representing a tangible effort to uplift communities, strengthen policy, and build resilience. These 338 dots in the chart are more than just data points; they represent real people, real changes, and real progress.
    </p>

      When I first set out on this journey, I knew the challenge would be turning raw data into a compelling story. The data, drawn from the <strong>UN INFO Platform – United Nations in Sri Lanka (2024)</strong>, isn’t just about categorizing projects. It's about understanding how each initiative weaves into the larger fabric of Sri Lanka's future. The chart captures more than just numbers; it captures a vision for the country—a future that is being built one initiative at a time.

      The spiral chart doesn’t just display data; it tells a story. Each category on the chart represents a facet of Sri Lanka’s growth, from policy-driven changes to grassroots efforts that are building stronger communities. It’s about making development tangible, giving it a visual form that anyone can engage with, regardless of their background or expertise.

    <p>
      In a world flooded with data, the challenge often lies not in the information itself but in how we make sense of it. The spiral chart in this project doesn’t just display data; it tells a story. The chart is interactive, allowing users to explore the depth of the data, understand the scope of the initiatives, and see how each effort is contributing to the broader goal of transforming Sri Lanka.

      As you navigate through this visualization, the story unfolds: from capacity development in education to critical service delivery in healthcare. The projects that make up this chart span across various sectors, each initiative carefully crafted to tackle the unique challenges that Sri Lanka faces.
